        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>For meal-prepping, food that is filling but low in calories is typically desired;
           for such meals, a lean ground beef is a great option. Using this recipe, we can turn something that
           is usually dry and tasteless into something that you may even be craving on a cheat day!</p>
